Project predicting the number of seasons a TV show will have


This was my first project with machine learning, written in November 2024. I used Google Colab to determine how many seasons a TV show will have. I made several mistakes with the project, such as using a Classifier instead of a regressor, and not including any visualizations. Regardless, it served as an excellent learning opprotunity.
